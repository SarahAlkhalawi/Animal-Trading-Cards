			<p>The wolf has upright ears and it resembles a dog. Telling a wolf apart
			from a dog can often be difficult, however, the wolf's tail often hangs
		 straight and its eyes are slanted. Wolf tracks are very similar to those
		 of a dog. A wolf's forepaws are bigger than its hindpaws. The wolf's
		 carnassial teeth are longer and larger than those of a dog.</p>
